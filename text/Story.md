# Never happened story

This story never happened. But I still want to tell you about this.
It happened once I was a young man. I wanted to see what is behind the ocean and the forest, who lives there and how.
This story started in Saint-Petersburg, the city on the north-west part of Russian Empire. At least what have left of
this empire on that moment. I've heard a lot of stories about different people abroad, about different cultures,
different music and folk. I was really curious about all that. And once I've gone there, that's how this journey begins.

Many many years later I've come to the small city between Jordan and Israel. I've come to visit the places, where the
big story about Jesus Christ has begun. This was a really small town, just a few buildings, many hotels and a lot of
stores. I've visited all sacred places and on my way back I've decided to come for a lunch. I chose some place, which
looked very nice for me and sat at a table near a window. Some strange woman came to me and asked me seriously:

- What are you doing here?
- Hello! I'd like to have lunch.
- But you should be upstairs we all are waiting for you just right now.
- Well, I don't quite understand. Are you sure, that this is me, who you are looking for?
- Okay. Right. If you want to play this game, let's play. Your name is Shchepotev Evgenii, right?
- Right...

I was totally confused: "Who is this woman? And why she knows my name? Maybe somebody looking after me to rob or
something like that.". But I've decided to continue play this game anyway. She saw my uncertainty and continued:

- So, are you ready to come with me?
- Well, I still would like to eat my lunch first.
- No, it's impossible, it wouldn't wait for you.
- It? What is it? Dog? Cat? Parrot?
- No, my darling, it's Universe!
- Do you know that you sound like crazy?
- Yes, this is possible. But still let's go with me right now!
- But what's the trick? Do you want me to rob or kill? I don't understand.
- As we are. We all aren't understanding a lof. But it still doesn't prevent us to be active and do something.
- Well fine, let's go, but I'm hungry. And when I hungry, I can be...
- ...upset? No worries, everything will be just fine.

We stood up from the table and went upstairs by some very old stairs. It was very strange, since the build from the
outside doesn't seem to be old. It looked like a building made in later 199x. The stairs were rounded around the column
and go up and up. I think it was lke three or four usual floors to get up on the second floor. But finally we got there.
There was a really huge room, it looked like in a church or a cathedral inside. This was a second strange thing in this
building. Because from the outside it looked like two-story house, very usual and not expensive. But here, inside it was
huge. The room was around one hundred meters long and at the end it had a small tiny door - about half of my size.

- You have to go there.
- Alone?
- Yes, good luck!

Everything became more and more strange...
